Replace existing file(s)
------------------------

Replace existing file(s) will trash any files in the output folder with the same name and extension as a newly exported file. This can help prevent confusion that may arise from having multiple files with the same name in the same folder.

The most recently updated file with the same name will not be trashed, but will instead have its contents replaced. This allows users to provide a permanent link to a JSON or XML file for use as a database or some other needed data set.
