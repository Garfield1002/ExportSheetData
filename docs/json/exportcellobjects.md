Export cell objects
-------------------
Export cells that begin with an open brace (`{`) and end with a close brace (`}`) as a JSON object.

This allows you to pack JSON data into a single cell and export it as a JSON object. If your cell value is not properly formatted for JSON, an empty JSON object (`{}`) will be exported instead.
